Blank Expression
================

Blank Expression is a colour scheme for Sublime Text 3.

To install the scheme, Preferences > Browse Packages, create a new folder and save the file in there. Then find it in Preferences > Color Scheme.

Blank Expression has a simple palette and minimal background highlighting, and works well for those working on HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP. It probably also works with other languages!

It draws inspiration from hazy memories of Visual Studio 6 and my dislike of colour overload. The file is based loosely on [Espresso Aqua](https://github.com/cafarm/aqua-theme). It was thrown together in half an hour using [TmTheme Editor](http://tmtheme-editor.herokuapp.com/).
